# Dotfiles
These are a series of my config files for i3-gaps window manager with polybar as the bar.

## Autoinstall

There is an autoinstaller tool for these config files.
You can find it in [this](https://github.com/lae-laps/archmaker) repo. It is a project in development, only working in Arch Linux for the moment

## Some examples:
