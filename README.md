# Dotfiles
These are a series of my config files for i3-gaps window manager with polybar as the bar.

  * *wm*: i3-gaps
  * *bar*: polybar
  * *terminal*: kitty
  * *launcher*: rofi
  * *editor*: vim
  * *notifications*: dunst

## Autoinstall

There is an autoinstaller tool for these config files.
You can find it in [this](https://github.com/lae-laps/archmaker) repo. It is a project in development, only working in Arch Linux for the moment
This project once made should give you a full tui with options to configure and install all required items in your new arch-linux install.

### For now

As all the files and directories are well placed you can just:

download the repo

`git clone https://github.com/lae-laps/dotfiles/` 

enter the directory

`cd dotfiles`

and move all the contents to your home

`mv * ~/`
