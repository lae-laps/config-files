# Dotfiles
These are a series of my config files for linux desktop. They currently work on i3-gaps wm and are tested in arch linux. To use them in your local machine, just clone the repository, `git clone https://github.com/lae-laps/dotfiles` in your home directory and run install.sh `chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh` This script will automatically back up all of your original files in case something goes wrong and put these instead.
